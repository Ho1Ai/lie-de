# What lie de is
lie de (lie.de) is an application which is compressing and decompressing packages. Developed for pipe package manager (standard package manager in WaxusBS). On alpha tests it won't compress files: it will just write different files in one. After that it will make files from this one file we got. So it is just a pipe package manager dependency, no more.
